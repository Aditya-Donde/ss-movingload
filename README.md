# Beam Analysis with Moving Loads using Influence Line Diagrams

This project simulates and analyzes the shear force and bending moment of a simply supported beam under a moving load system. It uses the concept of **Influence Line Diagrams (ILD)** to calculate maximum internal forces, and provides animated visualizations and a user-friendly **PyQt GUI** for interaction.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Calculate maximum reactions at supports A and B
- Compute bending moment and shear force at specific points
- Determine maximum shear force and bending moment with their positions
- Visualize shear force and bending moment distributions dynamically as the load moves
- PyQt GUI for user input and real-time animated plotting using `matplotlib`
